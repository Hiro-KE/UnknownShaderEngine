# Abstract Shader Engine
A small graphics/compute engine for path tracing and generating scenes with shapes.

This project is developed with a set of rules in mind:
- Robustness
- Performance
- For artists and programmers
- EMACS-like experience (where you may not need a mouse to progress faster)
- Portability for embedded systems (starting with raspberry pi lite os) to prove that a couple of RTX's are not required to make nice looking art.

## Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
